  Teamocil. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog.  I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands."

  I run a pretty tight ship around here. With     a pool table. It's a gaming ship. I like to look in the mirror. You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French.

  These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. You're blowing my mind, Frank. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann.It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City.

  Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire.Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit.Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.

    Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C.
